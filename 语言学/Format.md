### Useful Tips

#### Task One & Task Two

- Your answer should be as SPECIFIC as possible- You need to stick to a
point UNTIL you finish it, have done with it, and need never return to it again.
- The key to score high is to make each point WELL -DEVELOPED, and that
DOES NOT mean you need to make as many points as you can, two would be great.
- Truth and REASONABLE LIES are totally acceptable.
- DO NOT say "I have three(or whatever) reasons to support my idea, or
some thing like that after you state your opinion- 1 here is no guarantee
that you are able to finish your answer within 45 seconds- Instead, you
can say "I have a couple of reasons to say."



#### Task Three

- In the reading part, DO NOT waste your time on taking notes, it is unnecessary.
Just figure out what the announcement is mainly talking about, you do not need
to say anything about it after all- .
- When listening, just write down THREE major points-- attitude, reason 1 &
reason 2- You can use "+" and "-" to represent positive attitude and negative attitude.
- Make sure that you get ALL the reasons that the man/woman gives- Any thing
missed will lower your score.
- DO NOT spend too much time explaining why the school has pull out the policy,
simple words would be fine.
- DO NOT spend too much time retelling the first reason, you should finish talking
about it in 20 seconds.



#### Task Four

- Find the KEY words as soon as possible and then write them down.This is to
make sure that you will know what the professor is gonna talk about.
- Pay attention to the JARGONS in order to get familiar with the words that you
don't know before.
- Do not panic if you don't know anything about the subject, because your
opinion is NOT included.



#### Task Five

- The OPTIMAL time allotment is: 10 seconds for the problem, 17seconds for each
  solution, and 10 seconds for your choice and why, and about 6 seconds pausing
  throughout your answer.
- DO REMEMBER that you HAVE TO state your opinion in your answer.BUT do not
  spend too much time on that.

- Make your answer as SIMPLE as it can be, you really don't have enough time to
cover everything mentioned in the conversation.
- DO say "the man/woman offers her/him TWO(or THREE) solutions- This is to
ensure that you get all the solutions even if you can't finish you answer in time, SO
the examiner will still give you a good score.



#### Task Six

- The OPTIMAL time allotment is: 15 seconds for the theory/phenomenon, 20
  seconds for each example, and about 5 seconds pausing throughout you answer.
- Question 6, to a certain extent, is quite similar to question 4- However, Q6 is even
  HARDER because you don't have the chance to read anything about the lecture.
  So, stay ALERT while you are listening.
- Take as many details as you can, it HASN'T to be written in English, CHINESE is
  fine! Choose whatever the EASIEST way for you.

- You should catch the TRANSITIONAL WORDS, such as "what's more" and
moreover", which indicate that the professor is gonna talk about another point.

The lecturer rejects the ideas presented in the reading passage about the problems involved with the booming business of commercial fossil trading. In her opinion, the benefits of this new development outweigh its negative
consequences. The lecturer does not agree with the first point made in the reading that private collectors will keep their fossil collection away from the public, leading the public to lose interests in fossils. She contends that the
commercial trading of fossils actually makes them available to a wider public, because everyone with a budget, such as private schools and libraries, can purchase them for study and exhibition. The lecturer goes on to refute the
claim in the reading that fossil trading business prevents scientists and public museums from benefiting from fossil finds, as these parties cannot compete with wealthy private buyers to acquire important fssils for research
purpose. On the contrary, she argues, scientists themselves are the first to evaluate any important fossil before it can be sold in the commercial market at a price, so the academic community does not miss any opportunity to study
privately traded fossils. Additionally, the lecturer challenges the final downside of fossil trading mentioned in the reading.The lecturer reminds us that the damages, if any, caused by private collectors in their field operations are
more than offset by the effort they have made to increase the number of fossils available to the public that would otherwise remain undiscovered.

- Nowadays more and more families have personal computers at home, and children are more likely to expose to the computers at a very young age. As a result, many computer games are available for children in recent years.
  Many people are concerned about this fact and they believe playing computer games is a waste of time. However, I couldn' t disagree with this view of point more since I believe playing computer games could somehow benefit children. 
- First off, playing computer games offers children another way to meet more people and gain communication ability. Nowadays many computer games, such as World of War craft, need cooperation among lots of people.
  Children who involved in such kind of games have extra access to gaining social abilities. They can learn how to communicate efficiently with each other while playing. 
- Furthermore, playing computer games could help to improve children' s nelligence. This means that children who play games may be cleverer than their peers and can learn more things without suffer. Many games available today, such as Angry Birds, really need some knowledge and deep thought so that you could complete the tasks. Under this circumstance, children can be better at solving problems and smarter in the future. 
- What's more, computer games can be a very good way for relaxation. Children is modern society usually have more pressure and are more burdensome. By playing computer games, they can forget their worries and relax themselves. Their mind will be refreshed and they may be better at their work. 
- However, I have to admit that some children are just addicted to computer games and they waste their entire time sitting in front of the computers. In addition, there are many computer games which contain lots of violent scene which is
  harmful to children. 
- Anyway, these problems can be solved by letting parents to supervise their children about what is the proper game to play. All in all, I draw the conclusion that computer games can benefit children by offering opportunities to gain social abilities, improving intelligence and relaxing. Computer games are good things to enrich a child s life rather than ruin it.

雅思作文理由1. 效率efficiency

在很多文章中，笔者发现都可以将效率作为一个万能理由，比如写同意用手机发送短信，因为用手机发短信能提高效率;在手机和书信间选择用手机沟通 (托福写作)，因为手机能够提高效率，笔者总结了一句万能的跟效率相关的句子，以用手机发短信为例，用手机发短信能够提高效率在一定程度上能够提高效率， 这能节约大量的时间，这些时间能够被用来做更有意义的事情。

Sending text message could,to some degree,enhance efficiency,which saves a lot of time that could be uesd to do other things of greater significance.

大家细看一下这句话不难发现这句话融合了很多不同的句式，如插入语，即在一定程度上，非限，限定性定从，被动语态，of+名词 这一结构。

雅思作文理由2. 方便convenience

很多题目可以跟方便联系到一起。比如同意与否在社区建大学，如果同意可以说这样可以给当地学生居民带来方便。

雅思作文理由3. 刺激经济stimulate economy

比如同意与否在乡镇建立新公司，如果同意可以写这样做刺激了当地的经济及相关产业发展，增加了当地的税收收入，我们可以将增加了当地的税收收入 写成一个现在分词做分词结构，写成Establishing new companies in town could promote the progress of local economy and relevant industries ,increasing tax revenue.

雅思作文理由4. 节约

对于节约，可以用的万能理由有两个，一个是节约金钱，一个是节约资源，对于节约金钱而言，我们可以不用save money 这样的简单词汇，用be less time-consuming and more economical取而代之，而对于节约资源，使用短语preserve natural resources 即可.

雅思作文理由5. 就业

有一个题目叫是否同意在社区建大学，有的同学觉得这个话题不好写，其实用就业就很好展开，在社区建大学可以增加当地的就业机会，缓解当地就业压力Establishing community colleges may ，to some extent ，increase local employment opportunities ，which relieves the employment pressure.

雅思作文理由6. 竞争

激烈的社会竞争是很多题目的写作背景，笔者在这里特别为大家准备了一个黄金句型，叫很明显随着经济与社会的发展，竞争变得越来越激烈。It is conceivable that with the development of economy and society ,the competition is becoming increasingly acute and fierce.这是一个形式主语句型，用到了越来越这个单词，笔者没有用more and more这个“恶心词”， 而用increasingly代替，体现词汇的广度.

雅思作文理由7. 文化

很多题目可以和文化衔接上，如果做某件事可以对文化游好的帮助，大家可以用文化交流cultural exchange和文化融合cultural integration and synthesis这两个短语，而如果是对文化不好的影响，如文化同化，就可以用cultural assimilation这一短语.

雅思作文理由8. 权利

大家注意，这里的权利是right，而不是权力power。比如雅思考过一个题目，叫是否同意拿动物做实验，如果不同意，就可以说动物有生存权，the right for life.

雅思作文理由9.责任与义务

和权利相对的是责任与义务，同样上面的话题，你可以说人们有保护动物的责任与义务(responsibility and obligation).

雅思作文理由10.安全

雅思写作中跟安全相关的理由可以体现在食品安全,人身安全,财产安全和社会安全上,food security ,personal security,property security social security.
