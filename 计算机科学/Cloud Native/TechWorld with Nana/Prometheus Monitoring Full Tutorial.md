### How Prometheus Monitoring works | Prometheus Architecture explained

```c
► Part of the DevOps Bootcamp 🚀  More infos here: https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/d...

Fully understand how Prometheus Monitoring works | Explaining Prometheus Architecture | What is Prometheus Monitoring | Prometheus Monitoring Tutorial

Demo Part 1: Setup Prometheus Monitoring and Grafana on Kubernetes using Prometheus Operator  ►  https://youtu.be/QoDqxm7ybLc 
Demo Part 2: In the 2nd part we will actually configure Prometheus to expose /metrics endpoint and configure Prometheus to scrape it.  ►  https://youtu.be/mLPg49b33sA 🤓

Prometheus has become the mainstream monitoring tool of choice in container and microservice world. 🔥
In this video you will learn:
 1) Why Prometheus is so important in such infrastructure and what are some specific use cases
 2) How Prometheus works? What are targets and metrics?
 3) How does Prometheus collect those metrics from its targets?
 4) Furthermore, I explain Prometheus Architecture with simple diagrams and animations and go through the main components: Prometheus Server, Pushgateway, Alertmanager
 5) The advantages of Prometheus Pull System compared to alternative monitoring tools, which use  Push System
6) Using Prometheus Monitoring with Docker and Kubernetes

You will also understand better why it’s important to monitor your applications/infrastructure in general.
