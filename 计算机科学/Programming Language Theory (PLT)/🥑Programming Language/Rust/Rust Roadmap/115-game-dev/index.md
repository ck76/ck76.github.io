# Game Development

"Game development" is the process of designing, programming, and testing a video game. It involves various disciplines such as game design, which covers gameplay and story, arts and animation to ensure aesthetics and appeal, and programming for game interactions and mechanics. Game development can be approached using different tools and languages, and "Rust" has emerged as a powerful option thanks to its performance and safety aspects. It can be used to create both 2D and 3D games, and there are several libraries and frameworks in Rust meant specifically for game development, such as Amethyst and ggez. The process usually involves a game engine where most of the game contents are processed and a renderer where the game's visual representation is produced.
