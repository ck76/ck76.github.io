# Modules and Crates

In Rust, a module is a namespace that contains definitions of functions or types. You can choose to make the definitions visible in other modules or not. This provides a method of encapsulation for your code. On the other hand, a crate is a binary or library. It is the smallest unit of compilation in Rust. A crate can link to other crates, and it is composed of many modules. Therefore, the module system allows for code organization within a crate, and the crate system allows for building and sharing functionality among multiple projects.
