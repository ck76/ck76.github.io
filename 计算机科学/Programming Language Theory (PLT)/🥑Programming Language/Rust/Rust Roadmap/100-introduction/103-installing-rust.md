# Installing Rust and Cargo

To install Rust, navigate to the official website at [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org) and download the appropriate installation file for your operating system. For UNIX systems like Linux and MacOS, installation is as easy as running a single command in the terminal. For Windows, you'll be provided with a '.exe' installer which you need to execute. Further instructions can be found on the download page of the website. Keep in mind that you'll also need a linker of your operating system such as 'gcc'. You can update your Rust version at any time by running `rustup update` in the terminal.
