# Yew

"Yew" is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly. It features a component-based framework similar to React and Elm, and supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing the execution of JS code from Rust and vice versa. Yew is able to tap into Rust's powerful ecosystem, providing high-speed rendering and packing a punch when it comes to building rich, high-performing user experiences on the web.
