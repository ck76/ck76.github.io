# Control Flow Constructs

In Rust, control flow is managed through various structures like `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, and `match`. The `if` and `else` structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, `while` and `for` are used for looping over a block of code. The `while` loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of values like an array or a range. The `match` structure is a powerful tool in Rust which can be used for pattern matching. It goes through different cases and executes the block where the match is found.
