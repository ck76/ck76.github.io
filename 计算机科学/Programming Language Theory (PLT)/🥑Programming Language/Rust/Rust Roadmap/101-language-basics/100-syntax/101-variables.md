# Variables, Constants, and Data Types

In Rust, variables are declared using the `let` keyword. They are immutable by default, which means once a value is bound to a variable, it cannot be changed. If you want to make a variable mutable, the `mut` keyword is used. So, if you wanted to declare a mutable variable `x` and assign it the value `5`, you would write `let mut x = 5;`. Variables can also be patterned. By default in Rust, variables are block-scoped. Rust also supports several types of variable attributes.
