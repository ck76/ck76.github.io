# Tuple

In Rust, a **Tuple** is a type of data structure that holds a finite number of elements, each having potentially different types. Elements in a tuple are accessed using a dot (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to get. For example, to declare a tuple that includes a `32-bit integer`, a `single-byte unsigned integer`, and a `floating point number`, we would write `let my_tuple: (i32, u8, f64) = (500, 2, 20.5);` The index of elements in a tuple start from `0`. So, to access the first element, use `my_tuple.0`, the second element `my_tuple.1`, and so on. Tuples can also be used for multiple declarations and assignments. Tuples are particularly useful when you want to group together items of different types.
