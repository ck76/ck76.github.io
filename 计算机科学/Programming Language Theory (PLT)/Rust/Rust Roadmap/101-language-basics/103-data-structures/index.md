# Data Structures

In Rust, there are different types of data structures for organizing and storing data. Some of the primary types include:

- **Structures (structs)**: These are custom data types that allow you to combine multiple related values of different types. Structs implement methods and can also maintain private fields. Structs come in three types: classic C-style structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.
- **Tuples**: These are a sequence of fixed-size elements of possibly differing types. The elements of a tuple can be accessed using dot notation followed by the index starting from 0.
- **Enums (enumerations)**: These are data structures that allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Enum variants can be simple values or complex ones with fields.
- **Arrays** and **Vectors**: These are collections of items with the same type. An array is fixed-sized, while a vector can grow or shrink its size. Arrays and vectors store elements in contiguous memory locations.
- **Hash Maps**: A Hash Map keeps track of elements in key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary or a JavaScript object. They are great for quick lookups.

The Rust language also provides powerful reference and borrowing mechanism to control memory, data read/write access, and mutation to avoid problems like data races in concurrent scenarios.
