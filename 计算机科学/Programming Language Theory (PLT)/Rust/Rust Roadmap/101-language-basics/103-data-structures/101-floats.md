# Floats

In Rust, `floats` are used to represent floating-point numbers. They are defined as numerical values with fractional components. Rust supports two types of floating-point numbers: `f32` and `f64`. These are 32-bit and 64-bit in size, respectively. `f32` is a single-precision float, while `f64` has double precision. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `f32` but allows more precision. You can define a float in Rust like so: `let x: f32 = 3.0;`.
