# Lifetimes and Borrow Checker

In Rust, the concept of "lifetimes" is associated with borrowed references. A lifetime is a scope for which that reference is valid. The Rust compiler uses lifetimes to ensure those references are always valid. That is, the referenced object will not get destroyed while references to that object exist. When you are explicitly working with lifetimes in Rust, you are usually dealing with functions that accept references. Rust requires you to annotate the lifetimes when a function has one or more arguments of the borrowed reference type. The annotation is done using a set of angle brackets (<>), and inside these brackets, you declare your lifetime parameters, prefixed with an apostrophe ('). The Rust compiler uses these annotations to reason about how those references relate, and whether they are valid or not.
