`JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. In `Rust`, you can work with `JSON` data using the `serde` and `serde_json` libraries. The `serde` library provides a way for high-performance serialization, and `serde_json` is a `serde` format for handling `JSON` data. The library provides mechanisms for converting between `Rust` data structures and `JSON`. This includes the ability to parse `JSON` data from strings or files, serialize `Rust` data structures to `JSON`, and manipulate `JSON` values directly.
