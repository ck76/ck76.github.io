`Rust GDB` is a powerful tool used for debugging applications written in Rust programming language. It stands for the GNU Project debugger and has a wide range of features that are versatile for dealing with different tasks involved in debugging. With `Rust GDB`, you can carry out tasks such image inspection, trace execution, modify programs during runtime and break execution during specific conditions. It is usually used from the command line and supported on many Unix-like systems. It communicates directly with the processors and operating systems on a low level, making it a great tool for programmers looking to explore in-depth analysis of their Rust applications.
