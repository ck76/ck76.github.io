# wgpu-rs

`wgpu-rs` is a Rust project designed to make graphics programming more accessible for the Rust language. It is a library that allows users to easily interact with the graphic hardware in their system in a safe and comfortable way. The library provides a high-level, idiomatic and convenient abstraction over wgpu-core while still allowing low-level direct control over the underlying API. Through this, it provides a unified way to access graphics and computing functionality across various backends including Vulkan, Metal, DirectX, and browser WebGPU.
