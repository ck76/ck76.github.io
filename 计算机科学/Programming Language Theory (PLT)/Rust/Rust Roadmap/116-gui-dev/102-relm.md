# relm

`relm` is a declarative, event-driven framework for building GUIs in Rust. It is asynchronous and designed to handle complex user interfaces. `relm` uses `gtk-rs`, a wrapper for GTK+3, allowing for the creation of cross-platform GUI applications. Features in `relm` include Widget identification through name instead of Arc<Mutex<>>, asynchronicity framework using Futures, and seamless communication between widgets through the Model-View-Update architecture. The main focus of `relm` is to enable the creation of dynamic desktop applications with complex interactions, using the safe concurrency features of Rust.
