# Error Handling

Error handling in Rust is achieved primarily through two types of results: the `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>`. The `Result<T, E>` variant is used for functions that can result in an error. It has two variants, `Ok(T)` which indicates operation was successful and `Err(E)` when an error occurred. On the other hand, `Option<T>` is used for functions that can return a `none` value but not cause an error. This result type also has two variants, `Some(T)` indicates that the operation was successful and `None` specifies absence of a value. Rust's pattern matching features can be used to handle different types of errors thrown by these results. Furthermore, propagation of errors in Rust can be achieved using the `?` operator that returns early if the function fails. It's important to note that Rust does not have exceptions, thus eliminates the common problems associated with them.
