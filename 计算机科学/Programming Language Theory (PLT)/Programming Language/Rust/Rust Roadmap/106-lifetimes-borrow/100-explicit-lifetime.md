# Explicit Lifetime Annotations

In Rust, lifetimes are explicit and are determined at compile time. An `explicit lifetime` is one where lifetimes are annotated in function signatures. Explicit lifetimes are very important in situations where multiple references exist and Rust's compiler cannot make safe and correct assumptions on its own. They're denoted by a tick mark, followed by a lowercase letter. The most common default names for lifetimes are `'a`, `'b`, `'c`, etc. For example, in a function that borrows two strings, and returns a string, explicit lifetimes are used as: `fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str`. This allows the compiler to ensure that the references used in your function will remain valid for the entire time they're being used, preventing "dangling references".
