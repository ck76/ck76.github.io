# Pattern Matching and Destructuring

In Rust, `pattern matching` is a robust tool that allows you to destructure data types and perform conditional checks in a succinct and clear way. The main structures used for pattern matching are `match` and `if let`. The `match` keyword can be used to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things. The `if let` allows you to combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match a specific pattern. It's basically a nice syntax sugar over a `match` statement.
