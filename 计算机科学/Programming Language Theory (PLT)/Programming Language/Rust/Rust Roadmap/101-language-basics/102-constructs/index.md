# Constructs

In Rust, "constructs" refer to different elements used to build the structure of the program. This includes variables, functions, data types, control flow statements, and more. **Variables** store data, and their mutable or immutable status is determined at their declaration. **Functions** are reusable blocks of code defined by the `fn` keyword. Data types in Rust are static and must be declared upfront. These include simple ones like integers, boolean, float, etc, and complex types like arrays, tuples etc. **Control Flow** structures help direct the flow of execution. These include `if`, `else`, `loop`, `while`, `for`, and more. Exception handling uses the `Result` and `Option` enums along with the `match` construct. Rust's constructs like these come together to structure your program in a safe yet efficient manner.
