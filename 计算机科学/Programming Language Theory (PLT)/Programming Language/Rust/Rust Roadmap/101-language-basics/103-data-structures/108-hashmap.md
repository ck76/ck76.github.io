# Hashmap

The `HashMap` in Rust is part of the standard library's collections framework and it's a generic collection of key-value pairs. It allows for the quick lookup, insertion, and removal of items using hashing. A `HashMap<K, V>` holds a mapping of keys of type `K` to values of type `V`. The keys are unique and when a key gets inserted for the second time with a different value, the new value replaces the old value. Rust's `HashMap` uses a cryptographically strong hashing algorithm which can help avoid denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. It is however not ordered, so items may not be in the same order as they were inserted.
