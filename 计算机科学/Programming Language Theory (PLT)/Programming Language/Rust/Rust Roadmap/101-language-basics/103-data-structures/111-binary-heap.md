# BinaryHeap

A `Binary Heap` is a complete binary tree which is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Max Binary Heap, the key at root must be maximum among all other keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Min Binary Heap is similar to Max Binary Heap. But in a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all other keys present in Binary Heap. This property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Binary Heaps have efficient implementations on arrays.
