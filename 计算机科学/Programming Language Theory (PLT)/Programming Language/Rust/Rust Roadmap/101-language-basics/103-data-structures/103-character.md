# Character

In Rust, the `char` keyword is used to denote a character type. A `char` in Rust represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces are all valid `char` Types in Rust. It uses 4 bytes to store a single character. It is defined with single quotes like `let x: char = 'z';`.
