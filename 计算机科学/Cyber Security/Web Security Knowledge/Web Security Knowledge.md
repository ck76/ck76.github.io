# HTTPS

HTTPS is a secure way to send data between a web server and a browser.

Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of  HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web  browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security  of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit  sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service,  or health insurance provider
