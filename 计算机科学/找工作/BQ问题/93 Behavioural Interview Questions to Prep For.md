In a behavioural job interview, the interviewer asks behavioural interview questions about your past work experience. Behavioural questions (also known as STAR interview questions or behaviour-based interview questions) focus on how well you handle various work situations. They reveal your skills, abilities, and personality, as well as how suited you are to the role.

This interview technique helps hiring managers to ask questions that can tease out who you are, your skills, and how you approach difficult situations. The idea is past behaviour can often predict future behaviour.

Remember, hiring managers aren't looking for "yes" or "no" answers, but rather specific examples of how you handled a situation in a previous role or project.

[The STAR method](https://breakout.careers/advice/star-method/) is a way of answering behavioural questions that works well. It provides a framework to structure your answers into a brief anecdote that illustrates your strengthens, skills, and how you get along with managers and teammates.

What is the STAR method?

[The STAR technique](https://breakout.careers/advice/star-method/) is a useful strategy for responding to job interview questions. It provides a four-step process for organising your answers into a coherent structure that interviewers want:

- **Situation:** Describe the position you were in or the project you needed to accomplish. Use a specific event or situation, not a generalised description of what you have done in the past. Your response should provide the interviewer with enough details to understand the situation clearly. The situation can be from a previous job, volunteer role, or any relevant work experience.
- **Task:** What goals were you working toward?
- **Action:** Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on your work. Hiring managers want to know what specific steps you took and what your contribution was. Be careful you don't describe what team members or the company did, instead focus on your role. Use "I", rather than "we" when describing actions.
- **Result:** Describe the outcome of your actions and don't be shy to take credit for your achievements. What happened? What metrics were improved? How did your customers react to the new feature? What did you learn? Make sure your story contains positive results.

By answering behavioural questions with the STAR method, you can help hiring managers understand how your past work fits into the current role you are applying to.

Tips for answering behavioural interview questions

- **Prepare ahead of time:** This one seems obvious, but coming up with a story on the spot will generally lead to rambling. Have a few go-to stories that demonstrate a wide range of common behaviours hiring managers look for.
- **Use storytelling:** Preparing detailed anecdotes means you have time to develop a story before the interview (using the STAR method, for example) that you can draw upon.
- **Answer the question:** If the interviewer asks you a question and you can't think of a situation that applies, tell them. Being honest allows you to change the subject and answer with "but if I had encountered a situation like that, this is what I'd do."
- **Rehearsed, not robotic:** While you should prepare, don't read from a script. Remember, a job interview is a conversation, not an interrogation.
- **Focus on successes:** Avoid telling stories where you failed and learned nothing if you do need to tell a story that didn't have a positive outcome, anchor on what you learned and how that made you a better operator.
- **Take your time:** It's okay to take a moment before answering the question. Hiring managers want to give you the best shot at the job.
- **Be positive:** While behavioural interview questions often focus on times of stress or failure, don't focus too much on the negatives on the situation. Focus on what you did to solve the problem and the positive results.
- **Know yourself:** Remember, behavioural questions highlight your strengthens and weaknesses. Create responses that show you how you lean on your strengths and where necessary, fixed mistakes.
- **Focus on results:** Results is the last part of the STAR acronym and is one of the most overlooked. Remember to emphasise the positive outcomes of your actions and use numbers where you can.
