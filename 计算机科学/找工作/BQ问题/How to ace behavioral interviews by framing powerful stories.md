Having successfully secured top offers at Facebook and Google, I’ve sat on both sides of the interview table. As an interviewee, I sometimes left my audience overwhelmed with details, and my personality was drowned out. As an interviewer, I’ve interviewed dozens of completely unprepared candidates, which came as a total shock.

I’ll now demonstrate strategies that worked for me to ace behavioral interviews.

# Stay aware, be prepared

Companies want to use behavioral questions to **evaluate your ability to fit into the culture and collaborate**. I still remember my final Google interviews, when I was under a tremendous amount of stress. However, thanks to my diligent preparation, I was ready for any difficult questions.

To make a strong impression, you should **anticipate and prepare** solid pitches. Our brains are hardwired for narrative, therefore you should use stories to bring your answers to life. Below, I demonstrate the use of a thought map to prepare for the most common questions and to synthesize them into several categories. I recommend mastering one key story per topic.

# Craft your story

Crafting your story is all about **impact**. Your answers should be easy-to-understand, preferably shorter than 2 minutes. To avoid over-explaining, I recommend applying the “S.A.R” framework. Here is how I answered “Tell me about a situation when you had difficulties working with a colleague”:

As an interviewer, I have a set of criteria to **evaluate the experience and communication skills** of a candidate; a high level of self-awareness, your resume’s accuracy, collaborative mindset and how you handle failure. “S.A.R” enables you to structure your content clearly and help interviewers to follow your logic.

Furthermore, be sure to **leave out unnecessary details** such as; extensive project information, personal feelings about colleagues, etc. Your story should focus on **your actions and your thought process**.

# Practice, but maintain your authenticity

**Formulating a practice routine is essential for bringing confidence to your delivery.** Your goal should be prepared for any situation yet maintain your individuality.

After categorizing questions and applying the “S.A.R” framework to craft my stories, I then would record myself for self-critique and also receive feedback from friends. I would then refine until I am satisfied.

**Remember that interviews are two-way**; you are also interviewing the company. Be wary of over-tailoring yourself to a role or forcing a culture fit. This would lead you to landing a job that contradicts your abilities. Interviewers will expect you to **ask probing, intuitive questions** **to assess your curiosity, passion and motivation**. Here are some sample questions I used:

- What is the most challenging aspect of working here?
- How has your role changed since you were here? How will the role evolve?
- What is the collaborative dynamics among designers, product managers and engineers?
- What do you think makes this company’s culture unique?

# Summary

These were the strategies I took to secure top offers. The benefits of this preparation went beyond the interview itself. The interview process pushes you to examine yourself, which enabled me to **improve my self confidence and ability to express with clarity**. I hope by following my suggestions, you will be one step closer to nailing your interviews!
