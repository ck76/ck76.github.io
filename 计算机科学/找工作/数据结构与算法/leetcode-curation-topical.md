# leetcode-curation-topical

Curation of great Leetcode questions, categorized by topic/concept. My criteria for curation is that questions must be *valuable*, and not just difficult for the sake of being difficult.

Valuable questions can usually be solved in a variety of ways with different time/space efficiencies (through the use of various data structures), or require the application of certain common and reusable techniques.

Bad questions are those that are extremely difficult for the sake of being so, and require knowledge of some uncommon technique to solve (which cannot be applied outside a very narrow scope).

Essentially, this is a curation of questions that I personally use to prepare for technical interviews.
