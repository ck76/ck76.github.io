New Year Gift to every fellow time-constrained engineer out there looking for a job, here's a list of the best LeetCode questions that teach you core concepts and techniques for each category/type of problems! Many other LeetCode questions are a mash of the techniques from these individual questions. I used this list in my last job hunt to only do the important questions.

Good luck and Happy New Year!
