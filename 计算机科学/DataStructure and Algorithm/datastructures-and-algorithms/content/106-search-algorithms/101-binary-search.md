# Binary Search

`Binary Search` is a type of search algorithm that follows the divide and conquer strategy. It works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Initially, the search space is the entire array and the target is compared with the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target, and repeating this until the target is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Binary Search is log(n) as it cuts down the search space by half each step.
