# Polynomial

Polynomial time complexity, denoted as O(n^k), is a class of time complexity that represents the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as being proportional to the size of the input data raised to a constant power 'k'. Polynomial time complexity includes runtimes like O(n), O(n^2), O(n^3), etc. The value 'n' is a representation of the size of the input, while 'k' represents a constant. Algorithms running in polynomial time are considered to be reasonably efficient for small and medium-sized inputs, but can become impractical for large input sizes due to the rapid growth rate of function.
