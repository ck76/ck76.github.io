# Data Structures

Data Structures are a fundamental element of computer science. They provide a specific way to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Different types of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. Each of these has its unique characteristics and use-cases, and is optimal for certain kinds of operations. For example, arrays are excellent for random access, while linked lists work well for frequent insertions and deletions. The correct choice of data structure can significantly enhance the performance of your programs.
