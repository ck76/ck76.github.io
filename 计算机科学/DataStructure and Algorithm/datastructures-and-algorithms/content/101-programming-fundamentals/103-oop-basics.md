# OOP Basics

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and software. In OOP, each object is an instance of a class. A class defines the properties (often known as attributes or fields) and methods (actions) that are common to all objects of a certain kind. A key principle of OOP is the ability to hide certain parts of the objectsâ€™ data from the outside, a concept known as encapsulation. Other key principles are inheritance, a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined, and polymorphism, the concept of designing objects to share behaviors and being able to override shared behaviors with specifics.
