# Language Syntax

Language syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a particular programming language must be structured. This can include rules for how to declare variables, how to call functions, how to structure control flow statements, and so on. Syntax varies significantly between different programming languages, so it is critical to grasp the specific syntax of the language you are using. Itâ€™s similar to grammar in human languages - putting words in the wrong order or including extraneous punctuation can make a sentence hard to understand, and the same applies to programming. Incorrect syntax leads to syntax errors which prevent your code from executing.
