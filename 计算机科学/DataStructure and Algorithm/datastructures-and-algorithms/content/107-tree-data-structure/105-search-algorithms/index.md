# Search Algorithms

Search algorithms in context of the tree data structure typically include breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS). BFS traverses the tree level by level starting from the root. It visits all nodes at current depth or level before proceeding to nodes at the next level. On the contrary, DFS travels toward the deepest node first, which means it travels as far as it can down one path before backtracking and exploring the next available path. DFS has three types - pre-order (root, left, right), in-order (left, root, right) and post-order (left, right, root). Another important search algorithm is the Binary Search that operates only on sorted dataset and effectively halves the search space after each comparison. It seeks the mid-point of the array and compares it against the target value. If the mid-point value is greater, it repeats the process on the left half and if the mid-point value is less, then on the right half.
