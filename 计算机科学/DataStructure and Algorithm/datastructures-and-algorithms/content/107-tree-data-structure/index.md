# Tree Data Structures

A **Tree data structure** is a type of non-linear, hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It follows the parent-child relationship, with the top node being called the root. Each node in a tree can have child nodes and each of these child nodes has a single parent node. Nodes with same parents are known as siblings. Nodes without any children are referred to as leaves. Its structure allows the organization of data in a natural hierarchy. The simplification it provides in accessing, managing and manipulating data with complex relationships makes it a vital data structure in computer science. Implementations of the tree data structure are seen in databases, file systems, and HTML DOM.
