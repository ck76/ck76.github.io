# Trie

A **Trie**, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree, is a type of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike binary search trees, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of any one node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. A 'trie' is thus a way to represent the 're**trie**val' of information and is a type of tree structure used for this purpose. Typical usage scenarios could be in storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary, such as found on your smartphone or search engine.
