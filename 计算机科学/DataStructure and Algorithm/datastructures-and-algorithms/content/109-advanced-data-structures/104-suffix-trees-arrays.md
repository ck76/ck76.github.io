# Suffix Trees and Arrays

**Suffix Trees and Arrays** are advanced data structures used primarily for string manipulation and searches. A **Suffix Tree** is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given text as their keys and positions as their values. On the other hand, a **Suffix Array** is a sorted array of all possible suffixes of a given text. Both these data structures provide an efficient way to store and search substrings in a text, but differ in terms of space complexity and time complexity.
