# Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

A **disjoint-set** data structure, also called a union-find data structure or merge-find set, is a data structure that tracks a partition of a set into numerous non-overlapping subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. The underlying algorithm uses two main techniques, `Union by Rank` and `Path Compression`, to achieve the efficient time complexity. Each element is represented as a node, and each group of disjoint sets forms a tree structure. Disjoint sets are useful in multitude of graph algorithms like Kruskalâ€™s algorithm and many more.
