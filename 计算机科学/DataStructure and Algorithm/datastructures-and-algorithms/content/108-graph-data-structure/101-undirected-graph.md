# Undirected Graph

An **Undirected Graph** is a type of graph in which the edges are not directed. That is, they do not point in any specific direction and are not ordered pairs. They cannot be referred to as originating or ending node, instead, they are endpoints of the edges. In this type of graph, the edges essentially represent a two-way relationship, in the sense that, a travel can be made back and forth between the two vertices without any restriction. Every edge of the undirected graph always connects two different vertices or nodes.
