# Directed Graph

A **Directed Graph**, also known as a DiGraph, is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges. Each directed edge has an initial vertex, also called the tail, and a terminal vertex, also known as the head. The directed edge is said to point from the tail to the head. To visualize this, think of a graph where the nodes are cities and the edges are one-way roads. Directed graphs are often used to represent relationships between objects where direction does matter, such as a sequence of events in a workflow.
