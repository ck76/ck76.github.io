# Shortest Path Algos.

Shortest Path Algorithms are a set of algorithms used in graph theory to find the shortest path between two vertices or nodes. The two most well-known algorithms are Dijkstra's Algorithm and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm operates by visiting neighbors of the starting vertex and keeps a running tally of the shortest distance from the starting vertex to each visited vertex. This is repeated until all vertices have been visited and the shortest distances calculated. Bellman-Ford Algorithm, on the other hand, is capable of handling graphs with negative edges. It works by iteratively relaxing the graph edges and thereby finding the shortest paths to all vertices.
