# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular method used in computing and graph theory for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Named after Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, this algorithm works by visiting vertices in the graph starting from the object's starting point and gradually spreading out until the shortest path to the desired endpoint is known. This algorithm is applicable in such situation where all the edges are non-negative. Linear data structures such as stacks and queues are commonly used in the implementation of this algorithm. Although its worst-case time complexity appears to be high (O(|V|^2)), it runs significantly faster in practice.
