# Depth First Search

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The process starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph), and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a last in, first out (LIFO) stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search when a dead end occurs in any iteration. DFS has been used in a variety of applications including finding connected components, topological sorting, and finding articulation points (or cut vertices) in a graph.
