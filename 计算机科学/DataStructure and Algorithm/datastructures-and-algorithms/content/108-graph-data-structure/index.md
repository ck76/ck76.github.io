# Graph Data Structure

A **Graph Data Structure** consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and edges where each edge connects a pair of vertices. It can be visualized as networks consisting of elements in interconnected various relationships. There are two major types of graphs: Directed and Undirected. In a directed graph, all the edges are unidirectional - they only go one way. On the other hand, in an undirected graph, the edges are not directed - they are bidirectional. Another concept important to graphs is the idea of 'Weighted' and 'Unweighted' graphs. In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost. Unweighted graphs don't have these extra edge information. Graphs have a diverse set of applications in computer science, from creating connections between web pages to modeling networks and much more.
