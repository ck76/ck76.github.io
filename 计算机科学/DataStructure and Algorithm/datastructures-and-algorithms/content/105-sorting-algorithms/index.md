# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. For example, the numerical order is a commonly used sequence but a lexicographical order is also a commonly used sequence type. There are several types of sorting algorithms: quick sort, bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, radix sort, bucket sort among others. Each has its own properties and are suited to specific types of tasks and data.
