# Two Pointer Technique

The **two-pointer technique** is a strategy that can be used to solve certain types of problems, particularly those that involve arrays or linked lists. This technique primarily involves using two pointers, which navigate through the data structure in various ways, depending on the nature of the problem. The pointers could traverse the array from opposite ends, or one could be moving faster than the other - often referred to as the `slow` and `fast` pointer method. This technique can greatly optimize performance by reducing time complexity, often enabling solutions to achieve O(n) time complexity.
