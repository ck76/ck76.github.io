# Linear Indexing

Linear indexing is a type of data structure method where each element of an array is indexed successively in a linear format. This method treats multi-dimensional arrays as a long vector and provides a simple way to traverse through all the elements of the array in a sequence without the need for multiple loop statements. For instance, in a 2D array, the first index refers to rows and the second to columns. Using linear indexing, elements are indexed from top left to bottom right moving row by row. Despite its simplicity, this method is often less efficient than other forms of indexing for multidimensional arrays.
