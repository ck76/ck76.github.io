# Tree-Based Indexing

Tree-based indexing involves using data structures that follow a tree-like model, with parent nodes, child nodes, and leaf nodes in a hierarchical order. Two popular tree-based indexing methods are B-tree and B+ tree. In a B-tree index, every data record is associated with a leaf node, while internal nodes can be linked to a number of lower nodes within a certain range. On the other hand, B+ tree index structure makes all records reside at the leaf level, with the internal nodes only containing key values. The path from the root to every leaf node in both B-tree and B+ tree is the same length, which allows for efficient and consistent retrieval times.
