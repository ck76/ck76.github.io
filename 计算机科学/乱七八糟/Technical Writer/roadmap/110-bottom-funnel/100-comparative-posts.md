# Comparative Posts

"Comparative posts" are articles that focus on comparing different products, services, or tools. In these posts, the technical writer analyzes each item's features, application, and usability, sometimes even their prices, to help clients make informed decisions. It's imperative to note, comparative posts don't just pinpoint 'which is better?'. Instead, they delve deep into the specifics of ‘why and how’ an aspect of a product or service outshines the other. This kind of technical write-up is typically unbiased, comprehensive, and objective to maintain credibility and usefulness.
