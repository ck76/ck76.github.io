# Research Reports

Research reports are comprehensive documents that encompass a detailed study, investigation, or analysis carried out on a particular subject. They are used to understand a specific research problem by collecting and presenting sufficient evidence to provide solutions. These reports can be prepared by organisations, research institutions, or individuals in the field of study. They are used to understand industry trends, demographic data, market activity, and competition. They can also be used to analyze a hypothesis, prove a point, or provide insightful conclusions for a particular issue or topic. Research reports are essential resources for technical writers as they provide the necessary background and context to communicate complex technical information effectively.
