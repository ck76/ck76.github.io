# Content SEO

"SEO" stands for "Search Engine Optimization". It is a digital marketing strategy focused on boosting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results. Typically, the higher ranked on the search results page or more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO tactics can target various types of search like image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. It involves a range of activities such as keyword research and optimization, link building, and content creation, geared towards making a site more attractive to search engines. Beyond assisting with visibility, SEO also helps to improve the user experience and usability of a website.
