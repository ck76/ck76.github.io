# Frequently Asked Questions

"FAQs" stands for "Frequently Asked Questions". This is a crucial part of any technical document or user guide that compiles a list of common questions (with their respective answers) that users might have about a particular product, service, or topic. Good FAQs are clear, concise, and organized in a logical way. Typically, they are updated regularly based on user queries and feedback to remain helpful and relevant. FAQs can include instructions to resolve common user problems, terms and definitions, links to related resources, and other information useful for understanding and using the product or service effectively.
