# Subtle Selling

**Subtle Selling**: This is an approach in technical writing where the writer indirectly promotes or advocates for a particular product, service, or idea. Subtle selling is about providing informative, helpful content without overtly pushing a sale or marketing a product. It often involves highlighting the unique features or aspects of a product or service in the context of solving a problem or addressing a particular need, hence subtly influencing the reader to consider it. It's about clever positioning rather than overt persuasion, emphasizing the value a product or service can provide in a discreet and unobtrusive manner.
