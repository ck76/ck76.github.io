# References

References are an essential part of any technical document. They provide a means to verify the information you have given, adding credibility to your work. Cite sources from where you gather your data, facts or figures. According to the style of writing you are using, you may be required to provide in-text citations or footnotes. Also, there are various formats for creating a reference list or bibliography at the end of your document. Examples of some commonly used formats include APA, MLA, and Chicago. Always make sure that your references are relevant, current, and correctly cited to avoid plagiarism. The number of references may vary based on the type, length, and complexity of the technical document.
