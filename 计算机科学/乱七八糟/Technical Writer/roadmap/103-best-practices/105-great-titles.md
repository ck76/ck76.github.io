# Crafting Great Titles

Creating great titles is an essential best practice for technical writers. Titles should be engaging, accurate, clear, concise, and should provide a quick summary of what your article or document is all about. They should include keywords relevant to your content, but avoid jargon that could alienate your readers. Use active verbs instead of passive wherever possible to give your titles more impact. Also, make sure that your title doesn't promise something that the content doesn't deliver. Consider your audience and what would be most valuable and informative to them. Finally, always review and revise your titles as needed.
