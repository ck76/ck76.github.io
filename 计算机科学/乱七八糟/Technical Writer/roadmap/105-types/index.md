# Types of Technical Content

There are several types of technical writing, each focused on different aspects. **End-user documentation writers** specialize in creating materials for product users (like user manuals and quick start guides). **Traditional technical writers** draft articles, FAQs, guides, and other content primarily for websites. **API/SDK writers** are responsible for creating and maintaining documentation for application programming interfaces (Software Development Kits), which requires knowledge of multiple programming languages. **Medical writers** work in the medical sector and must understand medical concepts. **Grant and proposal writers** are essential for organizations obtaining funds for projects. Note that these are not all mutually exclusive; many technical writers span multiple categories.
