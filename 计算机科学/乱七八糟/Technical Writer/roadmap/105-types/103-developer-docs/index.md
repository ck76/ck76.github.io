# Developer Documentation

Developer docs, also known as developer documentation or API documentation, is a form of technical writing specifically aimed towards software developers. This type of documentation usually includes technical specifications of APIs, code comments, software design and architecture, and other detailed technical descriptions involved in software development. Developer docs are essential tools for developers as they provide the necessary guidelines, standards, and examples for using and integrating specific software, libraries, or APIs. The structure and comprehensiveness of developer docs can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the software it describes, but the main purpose is to help developers understand, utilize, and contribute to the software efficiently.
