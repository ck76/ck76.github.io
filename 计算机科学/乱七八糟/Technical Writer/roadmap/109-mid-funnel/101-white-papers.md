# White-papers

White papers are authoritative reports or guides that help readers comprehend an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. As a technical writer, crafting white papers comprise primarily of intricately marrying data with insightful commentary. These documents are usually more detailed and lengthier than blogs or articles, often extending to multiple pages. They have a formal tone, due to their informational and problem-solving nature, and they may include graphs, charts, or other visual aids to help explain the information presented, along with a detailed methodology and analysis.
