# Release Notes and Product Announcements

Release notes, often a part of software documentation, are brief, high-level summaries provided to the users during a new release of the product. They contain vital information about the updates, including new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and often known issues of the released software version. Each release note is associated with a specific software version and aids the users in understanding what changes or improvements to expect in that particular release. An effective release note will discuss new features or enhancements in a user-focused manner, identify any action required by the user, highlight known issues and workarounds, and contain links to more detailed information if necessary. It empowers users to use the software more effectively and troubleshoot potential issues.
