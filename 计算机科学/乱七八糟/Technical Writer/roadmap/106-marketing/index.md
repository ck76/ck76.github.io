`Marketing` is a business strategy which involves identifying customer needs and determining how best to meet those needs. In other words, it is about ensuring that a business or product is positioned in such a way that it will attract the desired audience, encouraging them to buy in. This strategy comprises multiple aspects including `market research`, `branding`, `product development`, `sales`, `promotion`, and `public relations`. Marketers use these tactics to create a company image, build customer relationships, attract potential customers and retain existing ones. The ultimate aim of marketing is to boost sales and help the business grow.
