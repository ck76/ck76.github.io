"Case Studies" are in-depth analyses often used by technical writers. They offer a detailed investigation into a specific subject, typically presenting real-world applications or scenarios. By employing a systematic approach, case studies can provide valuable insights which might not be achieved with other methods. They may contain extensive research, including interviews, observations, and data collection for quantitative and qualitative assessment. Case studies can encompass unique perspectives or complex matters, offering a rich understanding of the subject matter. They are often used in scientific, academic, and business contexts.
