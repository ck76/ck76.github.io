# Content Analysis

Content Analysis is a research methodology used by technical writers to interpret and quantify textual data. It involves a systematic process of coding and identifying themes or patterns within a body of text from different sources such as books, blogs, articles, or other document types. The primary goal is to provide a subjectively interpreted, yet valid and replicatable, inference from the data. This technique helps decipher whether the content in question conveys the desired communication effectively or if there are areas that require improvement. For example, you may conduct a content analysis to measure the user-friendliness of a software manual or the clarity and comprehensibility of an instructional guide.
