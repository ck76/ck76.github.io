# Search Trends

"Search Trends" refers to the analysis of the patterns, fluctuations, and shifts in the popularity of specific search terms over a given period. This data-driven approach can be leveraged to identify the trending topics or keywords among users, often within specific regions and contexts. Google Trends is a common platform for examining these trends, providing ample insights into the most recent or popular search queries. Utilizing search trends can allow technical writers to keep their content resonating with their audience by incorporating the latest or topical keywords, resulting in improved content visibility and relevancy.
