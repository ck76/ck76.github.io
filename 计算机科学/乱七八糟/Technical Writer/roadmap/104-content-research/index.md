`Content research` involves a systematic investigation into a specific subject matter in order to gather reliable and relevant information. This process is crucial for a technical writer as it helps in generating valuable content that's accurate, informative, and engaging. It goes beyond basic internet search; it includes reading technical documents, interviewing experts, conducting surveys, and analyzing data. Content research should be conducted in a strategic manner, taking into consideration the purpose of the information, the target audience, and the key message to be conveyed. A well-executed content research process helps technical writers produce high-quality content that's both clear and concise.
