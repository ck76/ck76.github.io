# Git / Version Control

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system, designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning-fast performance. Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development take seconds. It also provides strong support for non-linear development, numerous workflows, and robust features such as strong cryptographic authenticity of history.
