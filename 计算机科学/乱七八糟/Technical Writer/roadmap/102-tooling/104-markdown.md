# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It was created by John Gruber, with significant contributions from Aaron Swartz, with the goal of allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format". Key features include automatic production of well-structured, ready-to-publish documents from 'readable' text files. Its syntax includes items like headers (`# Header`), bullet lists (`- item`), italics (`*text*`), bold (`**text**`), links (`[description](url)`) and so forth. Markdown files usually end with `.md` or `.markdown`.
