# Tooling

In the realm of technical writing, "tooling" refers to the various software and applications technical writers utilize to create, manage, and publish high-quality technical documentation. This can include word processors, desktop publishing apps, XML editors, content management systems, and many more. Some popular examples of tools used by technical writers include Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Adobe FrameMaker, MadCap Flare, Markdown, GitHub, and Jira. These tools enhance productivity by allowing for document versioning, enabling collaboration, offering templates for consistent formatting, providing features for managing large amounts of content, and even offering functionality for translating documentation into multiple languages. The choice of tools depends on the specific needs and workflow of the technical writer or the organization they are working for.
