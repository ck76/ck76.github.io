# Web Components

Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to  create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated  away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.

# HTML Templates

The `<template>` HTML element is a mechanism for  holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is  loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using  JavaScript. Think of a template as a content fragment that is being  stored for subsequent use in the document.

# Custom Elements

One of the key features of the Web Components standard is the ability to create custom elements that encapsulate your functionality on an  HTML page, rather than having to make do with a long, nested batch of  elements that together provide a custom page feature.

# Shadow DOM

An important aspect of web components is encapsulation — being able  to keep the markup structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate  from other code on the page so that different parts do not clash, and  the code can be kept nice and clean. The Shadow DOM API is a key part of this, providing a way to attach a hidden separated DOM to an element.
