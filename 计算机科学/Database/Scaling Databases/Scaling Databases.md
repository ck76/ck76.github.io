# Scaling Databases

Scaling databases is the process of adapting them to handle more data and users efficiently. Itâ€™s achieved by either upgrading existing  hardware (vertical scaling) or adding more servers (horizontal scaling). Techniques like sharding and replication are key. This ensures  databases continue to be a robust asset as they grow.
