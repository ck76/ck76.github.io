出国留学自我介绍范文篇4
　　Good morning, professors.

　　I am XXX from XXX university, and my major is XXX. Today ,it’s my great honor to be here. Now let me briefly introduce myself to you.

　　I am very humorous and easy-going, enjoying a good relationship among my classmates. During the past three years, I have worked very hard at my studies. As a result ,I built up a solid foundation of professional knowledge. I’d like to take the chances to put them into practice via many kinds of projects and contests. Such experience has taught me the theoretical principles and practical methods to carry out research antivities. What's more, now I am good at analysis, with a strong sense of cooperation. I am always willing to achieve higher goals.

　　In my spare time, I was very active and took part in different social activities, especially the volunteer activities, which cultivated me leadership skills, team spirits and the ability to deal with problems. Besides, books and sports are also my favorite entertainments.

　　Although I have broad interests in many aspects and grasp the essential knowledge of the major, but I think at present, I can do many things in a superficial level, but not be competent to do things professionally owing to lack of ample knowledge and ability. So I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value.

　　All in all, XXX university, with a highly qualified faculty and strong academic environment is the one which I have long admired. So I hope to enter this college and further my education here.

　　That’s all .Thank you.

早上好,教授。

我是XXX大学的XXX，我的专业是XXX。今天，我很荣幸来到这里。现在让我简单介绍一下我自己。

我很幽默随和，和同学们关系很好。在过去的三年里，我一直很努力地学习。因此，我建立了坚实的专业知识基础。我愿意抓住机会，通过各种项目和比赛将这些想法付诸实践。这段经历教会了我开展研究活动的理论原则和实践方法。更重要的是，我现在善于分析，有很强的合作意识。我总是愿意达到更高的目标。

在课余时间，我积极参加各种社会活动，特别是志愿者活动，培养了我的领导能力、团队精神和处理问题的能力。除此之外，书籍和运动也是我最喜欢的娱乐方式。

虽然我在很多方面都有广泛的兴趣，掌握了本专业的基本知识，但我认为目前我可以做很多肤浅的事情，但由于缺乏丰富的知识和能力，不能胜任专业的做事。所以我认为进一步的学习仍然是我迫切需要实现自我价值。

总之，XXX大学拥有高素质的师资队伍和良好的学术环境是我一直以来所钦佩的。所以我希望能进入这所大学并在这里继续我的教育。

就这些，谢谢。
