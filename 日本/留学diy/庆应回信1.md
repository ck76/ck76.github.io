Dear chengkun,

Thank you very much for your interest in my lab.

Since English ability will be very important if you want
to come to my lab, I am replying in English on purpose.

First, you seem to be interested in taking
一般入試（日本語）2021年６月入学試験.
Is there any reason you are not thinking of the
International Graduate Program (Master's)?
    https://www.st.keio.ac.jp/en/admissions/
If you are accepted to Keio, there is basically no
difference between the two.

Second, I do not know what will happen due to COVID,
but if you choose 一般入試（日本語）2021年６月入学試験,
then you will likely need to have an interview to be
accepted. And normally that interview will be in-person,
i.e., you will need to come to Japan and take that
interview here. Again, the COVID situation makes it difficult
to foresee what will happen, but please keep this in mind.

Please note that (I think) you will not be allowed to take
both the International version and the Japanese version.
Otherwise, it will not be fair to other prospective students.

Here are some questions.

(1) What are you interested in?
You gave Android, programming language and virtual machine
as things you are interested in. Can you be more specific
as to what research you would like to do if accepted to Keio?
A research proposal would be beneficial.
Note that Keio's computer science is focused on research and
NOT lectures. If you are more interested in lectures, then Keio is
probably not a good fit.

(2) Have you have taken the GRE? If so, what was your score?

(3) Your CV lists programming languages you have experience
with. Can you tell me your level of proficiency of the (2 or 3)
programming languages you use the most?  Furthermore, what is
the largest program you have written?

(4) Do you need a scholarship?

(5) Why Keio and Japan?
Are you planning on taking exams for other universities?

(6) Assuming you are accepted by Keio and graduate,
what are your aspirations afterwards?

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Shingo Takada

我并不是心血来潮给您发邮件，在这之前我对您和庆应大学都做了全面的了解。

下面是对您的问题作出的解答。

(1) What are you interested in?
You gave Android, programming language and virtual machine
as things you are interested in. Can you be more specific
as to what research you would like to do if accepted to Keio?
A research proposal would be beneficial.
Note that Keio's computer science is focused on research and
NOT lectures. If you are more interested in lectures, then Keio is
probably not a good fit.

我最喜欢的一段话：

而且在我过去的工作经验当中深深体会到一个合适的架构对于软件开发的重要性。所以我想要研究更适合于超大型Android软件的架构。

我对研究更感兴趣，不是讲座。我坚信我想要上庆应大学。



(2) Have you have taken the GRE? If so, what was your score?

我并没有参加GRE考试。我之前对IGP和一般考试都做了全面的调查，我很仔细的阅读了它们募集要项，并且咨询过教务处。由于IGP需要GRE和TOEFL成绩，但是我没有。而且现在由于疫情，大部分考试被取消。这导致很难抢到考试位置。

我对于我的英语有信心，我的阅读能力很好，我相信这不会阻碍我的研究。尽管我的口语不是很流利，但是距离2022.04还有一年多的时间，我相信我能锻炼好它。而且我浏览了实验室的主页，这里也有中国学生，我相信我能很好的融入实验室。



对于一般入试，我仔细的读过募集要项，募集要项要根据材料审查来决定是否需要面试。而且2020.6的一般考试因为疫情取消了面试。日本延长了紧急事态宣言。我认为今年仍然会取消面试，或者会改为线上面试。因为现在日本全面禁止外国人入境，所以所有的外国人都不能够进入日本，我相信校方一定会采取相应的措施。



(3) Your CV lists programming languages you have experience
with. Can you tell me your level of proficiency of the (2 or 3)
programming languages you use the most? Furthermore, what is
the largest program you have written?

Proficiency :  Java>Kotlin>Python

我之前和现在的工作是Android工程师。请您完全信任我的编码能力。

我开发过的最大的项目是VigoVideo，这是一个和TikTok同类型的软件，但是它的主要市场是南美洲和印度

https://www.vigovideo.net/

但是TikTok和我们属于一个部门，我经常阅读TikTok的源代码。

https://www.tiktok.com/

我现在在Baidu，百度也是一个超级大型的软件，但是我刚来不久。

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu

(4) Do you need a scholarship?

我不需要奖学金。入学后我想要专心研究。我现在是B4。我拿到了【内定】，我现在有每月40万日元的工资，而且我的父母可以支持我，我没有经济上的问题。

(5) Why Keio and Japan?
Are you planning on taking exams for other universities?

因为我真的是特别喜欢日本的文化，各个方面。尤其我是动漫迷。毕业以后我想要留在日本生活和工作。我真的是太爱日本了。

庆应大学是日本的最好的大学，而且我在浏览了教职员表之后发现我对您的研究领域非常感兴趣。如果没有疫情我本来打算坐飞机到日本去参观您的实验室。我真的是非常希望您能做我倒导师。请您给我一个机会。我真的是一个非常勤奋的人。我会全身心的投入。我会做到我的最好，我一定不会让您失望。

我不打算参加别的学校的考试。我非常希望您能做我的导师，因为我认为我们的匹配度100%。如果今年因为疫情我不能参加庆应的考试。我会等到明年、后年、大后年……。我不会放弃，直到我有机会去日本。但是如果我被庆应大学接收，我就可以获得留学签证。

(6) Assuming you are accepted by Keio and graduate,
what are your aspirations afterwards?

我热爱软件开发，我将来想做日本乃至全世界最优秀的软件工程师。在我对日本熟悉并且积攒了一定的经验和金钱和人脉之后。我想要创立自己的IT公司。因为我发现日本的IT市场，还有很多的创业机会。

我真诚的希望您能接受我。

Best regards,
chengkun

Dear Professor Takada 

I am not sending you an email on a whim. Before that, I had a thorough understanding of you and Keio University.
Below is the answer to your questions.

(1) What are you interested in?
You gave Android, programming language and virtual machine
as things you are interested in. Can you be more specific
as to what research you would like to do if accepted to Keio?
A research proposal would be beneficial.
Note that Keio's computer science is focused on research and
NOT lectures. If you are more interested in lectures, then Keio is
probably not a good fit.

My favorite passage:プログラム開発は，多くの人々が目的達成のため，もがき苦闘するタールの沼であるとともに，また独自の喜びと苦悩を伴った創造的活動でもある”——フレデリック・ブルックス『人月の神話』

And in my past work experience, I deeply understand the importance of a proper architecture for software development. So I want to research more suitable architectures for super large Android software.

I am more interested in research than lectures. I firmly believe that I want to go to Keio University.

(2) Have you have taken the GRE? If so, what was your score?

I did not take the GRE test. I have done a comprehensive survey of IGP and general exams before, and I have read them carefully and consulted the Affairs Office. Because IGP needs GRE and TOEFL scores, but I don't have them. And now due to the epidemic, most exams have been cancelled. This makes it difficult to get a chance to take the exam.

I have confidence in my English and my reading ability is very good. I believe this will not hinder my research. Although my spoken English is not very fluent, there is still more than a year before 2022.04. I believe I can exercise it well. And I browsed the homepage of the laboratory. There are also Chinese students here. I believe I can integrate into the laboratory well.

For the general entrance examination, I have carefully read the 募集要項. The decision of whether an interview is required depends on the material review. Moreover, the general examination of 2020.6 cancelled the interview due to the epidemic. Japan has extended its emergency declaration. I think the interview will still be cancelled this year, or will be changed to an online interview. Because Japan currently prohibits foreigners from entering Japan, all foreigners cannot enter Japan. I believe the school will take corresponding measures.

(3) Your CV lists programming languages ​​you have experience
with. Can you tell me your level of proficiency of the (2 or 3)
programming languages ​​you use the most? Furthermore, what is
the largest program you have written?

Proficiency: Java(very skilled)>Kotlin>Python
My previous and current job is an Android engineer. Please trust my coding ability completely.
The biggest project I have developed is Vigo Video, which is the same type of software as TikTok, but its main markets are South America and India
https://www.vigovideo.net/
But TikTok and we belong to the same department, and I often read TikTok's source code.
https://www.tiktok.com/
I am now in Baidu, and Baidu is also a super large software, but I just came here not long ago.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu

(4) Do you need a scholarship?

I don't need a scholarship. I want to concentrate on research after enrollment. I am B4 now. I got the [内定], I now have a monthly salary of 400,000 円, and my parents can support me, I have no financial problems.

(5) Why Keio and Japan?
Are you planning on taking exams for other universities?

Because I really like Japanese culture, all aspects. Especially I am an anime fan. After graduation, I want to live and work in Japan. I really love Japan so much.

Keio University is the best university in Japan, and after browsing the faculty list, I found that I am very interested in your research field. If there was no epidemic, I planned to fly to Japan to visit your laboratory. I really hope you can be my supervisor. Please give me a chance. I am really a very hardworking person. I will devote myself. I will do my best and I will not let you down.

I don't plan to take the exams in other schools. I hope that you can be my supervisor, because I think our match is 100%. If this year I cannot take the Keio exam because of the epidemic. I will wait until next year, year after year, year after year... I will not give up until I have a chance to go to Japan. But if I am accepted by Keio University, I can get a student visa.

(6) Assuming you are accepted by Keio and graduate,
what are your aspirations afterwards?

I love software development, and I want to be the best software engineer in Japan and the world. After I became familiar with Japan and accumulated a certain amount of experience, money and connection. I want to start my own IT company. Because I found that there are still many entrepreneurial opportunities in the Japanese IT market.

I sincerely hope that you can accept me.

Best regards,
chengkun
